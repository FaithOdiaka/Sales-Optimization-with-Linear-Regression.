# Sales-Optimization-with-Linear-Regression.
This project aims to help a sales company maximize the number of units sold for a particular product. By utilizing a simple linear regression model, we analyze how the combination of three independent variables—promotion, advertisement, and the price of the product—impacts the number of units sold.
